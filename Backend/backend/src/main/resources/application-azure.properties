# Azure Blob Storage Configuration for 'azure' profile

# Option 1: If using DefaultAzureCredential (e.g., via 'az login' or environment variables for service principal)
# You'll still need the storage account name and container name.
# The endpoint is typically https://<accountName>.blob.core.windows.net/
azure.storage.account-name=cloudflixstoragetest
azure.storage.container-name=videos
# e.g., cloudflix-videos
# azure.storage.blob-endpoint=https://yourstorageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/ (Optional, can be derived)

# Option 2: If using a Connection String (less ideal than DefaultAzureCredential for local dev if az login is an option)
# Set this as an environment variable: AZURE#STORAGE#CONNECTION#STRING
# If you absolutely must put it here (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GIT), it would be:
<<<<<<< HEAD
# azure
# storage
 # connection-string
=======
# azure.storage.connection-string=
>>>>>>> a31dfd9 (Aws s3 and Azure Storage Testing Completed 01)
# And you would still need:
# azure.storage.container-name=yourvideocontainername

# SAS Token (for pre-signed URLs) duration
azure.storage.sas-token.duration-hours=1
# How long generated SAS URLs are valid
